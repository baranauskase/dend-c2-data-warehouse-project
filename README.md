# Introduction

In this project, I'll apply what I've learned on data warehouses and AWS to
build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project,
I will load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL
statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

# Background

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database
and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3,
in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory
with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I'm tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts
their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of
dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what
songs their users are listening to. I'll be able to test the database and ETL
pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and
compare my results with their expected results.

# Datasets

I'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

 - Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
 - Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

## Songs

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song](http://millionsongdataset.com/) Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{
    "num_songs": 1,
    "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
    "artist_latitude": null,
    "artist_longitude": null,
    "artist_location": "",
    "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
    "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
    "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
    "duration": 152.92036,
    "year": 0
}
```

## Logs

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset I'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like.

# Development environment
This project is implemented using Python3 and AWS. It is good practice not to
contaminate your global Python installation by
installing dependencies that are specific to this project. The first step 
therefore is to create a virtual Python environment. We will utilise the most
basic approach by creating an environment using `venv` module. At the root of 
the project run the following commands.

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now that the virtual environment is ready. The next step is to spin up a Redshift
cluster. There is a [SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) template,
which makes it easy to deploy the necessary resources using the concept of
infrastracture as code.

```shell
sam deploy --guided
```

> Please note that the template is not fully productionised and you might encounter
deployment issues since `VPC` and `Subnet` CIDR blocks are hardcoded. Also the
cluster is deployed on a public subnet, which is generally not a good practice.  

# Project structure

1. `create_table.py` is where fact and dimension tables are created for the star schema in Redshift.
2. `etl.py` is where data is loaded from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into the analytics tables on Redshift.
3. `sql_queries.py` is where SQL statements are defined, which are imported into the two other files above.


# Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and event datasets, I've created a star schema optimized for
queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

## Staging Tables

- `stg_events` - event data that assumes exactly the same strcture as the raw event data files.

- `stg_songs` - song data that assumes exactly the same structure as the raw song data files. 

## Fact Table

- `fact_songplay` - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with *page* `NextSong`. This fact table has the following attributes: *songplay_id*, *start_time*, *user_id*, *level*, *song_id*, *artist_id*, *session_id*, *location*, and *user_agent*.

## Dimension Tables

- `dim_user` - users in the app. This dimension table has the following attributes: *user_id*, *first_name*, *last_name*, *gender*, and *level*.

- `dim_song` - songs in music database. This dimension table has the following attributes: *song_id*, *title*, *artist_id*, *year*, and *duration*.

- `dim_artist` - artists in music database. This dimension table has the following attributes: *artist_id*, *name*, *location*, *lattitude*, and *longitude*.

- `dim_time` - timestamps of records in `fact_songplay` broken down into specific units: *start_time*, *hour*, *day*, *week*, *month*, *year*, and *weekday*.

## ETL

The ETL process in this solution is fairly basic and does not use any workflow frameworks and/or tools. First we run the data definition language (DDL) queries to create all the tables in the database. Then `COPY` queries are executed that load the song and log data from `S3` into the corresponding staging tables. Finally we run queries that select relevant subsets of data from the staging table to populate fact and dimension tables. The loading of data from staging into facts and dimensions also apply the necessary transformations, such as braking down dates into date components, filtering event data, and joining song and event data to derive `fact_songplay` data. 

## Analytics

The purpose of this data warehouse is for the analytics team to find insights into what songs their user like to listen to. The fact and dimension tables allows to easily answer the questions, such as that are the trending songs and/or artists or what specific users like to listen to. Below is an example of a query that builds a list of top three most played songs each week.

```SQL
WITH weekly_chart AS (
  SELECT
      dt.week,
      ds.title,
      da.name,
      COUNT(fs.songplay_id) num_plays
  FROM fact_songplay fs
  JOIN dim_song ds ON ds.song_id = fs.song_id
  JOIN dim_artist da ON da.artist_id = fs.artist_id
  JOIN dim_time dt ON dt.start_time = fs.start_time
  GROUP BY dt.week, ds.title, da.name
), weekly_ranked AS (
  SELECT 
    week,
    title,
    name,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY week ORDER BY num_plays DESC) rank
  FROM weekly_chart
)
SELECT 
    week,
    title,
    name,
    rank
FROM weekly_ranked
WHERE rank < 4
ORDER BY week, rank
```
