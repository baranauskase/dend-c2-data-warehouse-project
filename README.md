# Introduction

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to
build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project,
you will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL
statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

# Background

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database
and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3,
in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory
with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts
their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of
dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what
songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL
pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and
compare your results with their expected results.

# Datasets

I'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

 - Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
 - Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

## Songs

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song](http://millionsongdataset.com/) Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{
    "num_songs": 1,
    "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
    "artist_latitude": null,
    "artist_longitude": null,
    "artist_location": "",
    "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
    "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
    "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
    "duration": 152.92036,
    "year": 0
}
```

## Logs

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset I'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like.

# Development environment
This project can be implemented on a local machine using Python3 and Docker. The 
instructions here assume that VS Code is used as a development environment,
especially the way `ipython` kernel is setup instead of using `jupyter notebook`.
It is good practice not to contaminate your global Python installation by
installing dependencies that are specific to this project. The first step 
therefore is to create a virtual Python environment. We will utilise the most
basic approach by creating an environment using `venv` module. At the root of 
the project run the following commands.

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now that the virtual environment is ready. The next step is to spin up a `PostgresSQL`
server. The cleanest way is to run an official `Docker` container and we can do
so by deploying the stack.

```shell
docker stack deploy -c postgres-stack.yml postgres
```
If the `Docker` engine is not running in `swarm` mode then it is also possible to
use `docker-compose` to deploy this stack.

# Project structure

1. `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table to let us check the database.
2. `create_tables.py` drops and creates the tables. This file can be run to reset tables.
3. `etl.ipynb` reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into the tables. The purpose of this notebook is to analyse the data.
4. `etl.py` reads and processes all files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the tables.
5. `sql_queries.py` contains all sql queries.

# Next steps
- Insert data using the COPY command to bulk insert log files instead of using INSERT on one row at a time
- Add data quality checks
- Create a dashboard for analytic queries on the new database
